    <h2>Strong Passwords</h2>
    <img src="https://example.com/strong-password.jpg">
    <p>A strong password is made up of at least 16 characters and contains upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Strong passwords also follow best practices, avoiding personal information, dictionary words, and never being reused across multiple accounts.</p>

    <h2>Identify Safe and Unsafe Sites</h2>
    <img src="https://example.com/website-security.jpg">
    <p>Website owners are responsible for visitor safety, but some websites can spread malware or steal information. Here are three ways to identify a safe site:</p>
    <ul> 
        <li><strong>Look for HTTPS:</strong> Sites with "HTTPS" use encryption. Sites with only "HTTP" may be unsafe.</li>
        <li><strong>Check for a Privacy Policy:</strong> A legitimate site has a clear privacy policy about data handling.</li>
        <li><strong>Find Contact Information:</strong> Trustworthy sites provide contact info. A survey showed 44% of users avoid sites without it.</li>
